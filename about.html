                    My name is Caleb Besser, I was born December 1, 1998. I am a Chico State Graduate, with a Bachelors of Science, in Computer Science.
                    I enjoy the problem solving side of programming, figuring out the root of a problem and finding the answer from there. I have experience in many 
                    different languages, such as C, C#, C++, OCaml, Python, Javascript, and many more. But my main and favorite language is most likely C#, it and C
                    are where I have spent a majority of my time.

                    I currently am seeking employment in the Software Engineering field, and specifically Front/Backend Web/App Development. This is 
                    where I have found most of my practice going as creating software that people can actually use and interact with is an enjoyable and 
                    enriching experience, it's what brings me a lot of joy. 
                </p>

                    If you're visiting this site as an employer, I have a <a class="inline_link_about" href="contacts.html">Contacts Page</a>  where you can find
                    any and all ways to get in touch with me. If you're just someone poking around, I have a <a class="inline_link_about" href="projects.html">Projects Page</a> where you might find something interesting,
                    that I hope motivates you to try making stuff yourself. Either way, whoever you are, have a great day!
